## 📈 Summary
The model estimates a DCF-based intrinsic value of £74,000 compared to a current market value of £64,000. With projected rent of £600/month (vs. a market benchmark of £540), this suggests that the property is undervalued. A £60/month buffer offers protection against rising interest rates.
